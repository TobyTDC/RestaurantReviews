Contributing
============

For fixes, improvements and ideas, fork the repository and issue a pull request.
To get a pull request accepted, please adhere to these two rules:

- Work from the latest `develop` branch, unless it's a very small fix
- Respect current code style (indent with tabs, compare to existing code for more clues)

Ideally, only work on one feature at a time.
If you've done work on the code (i.e. not just fixes to the README), add yourself to the top of [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Happy coding!
